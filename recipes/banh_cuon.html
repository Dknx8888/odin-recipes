            <p>Add minced beef to a bowl along with fish sauce, salt, pepper and seasoning granules. Mix well and leave it sit for about 15 minutes to allow the meat to absorb the flavours.</p>

            <p>Sauté the onions in a pan with a little cooking oil until fragrant, then add the meat and stir-fry until it is firm. Next, add the wood ear mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms to the pan, stir well for 30 seconds, then turn off the heat.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Creating The Batter</h3>
            <p>Mix both flour together in a large pot. Gradually pour 1.2 liters of water into the flour while stirring to ensure the mixture is completely dissolved and smooth without lumps.</p>

            <p>Add cooking oil and salt to the batter and refrigerate for about 1 hour.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Assembling The Rolls</h3>

            <p>Place a non-stick pan on the stove over medium heat and coat it with a thin layer of cooking oil. You can also use a cotton ball dipped in oil and held with chopsticks to spread the oil.</p>

            <p>Once the pan is moderately hot, pour 1/2 tbsp of batter mixture into the pan. Quickly tilt the pan to spread the batter evenly, then cover with a lid for 15-20 seconds.</p>

            <p>As soon as the batter is cooked, <em>carefully</em> transfer it onto a plate that has been pre-greased with a layer of cooking oil. Add the filling, spread it evenly, and gently roll up the batter while it is still hot. Repeat the process until all the prepared ingredients are used up.</p>
