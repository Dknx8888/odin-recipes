    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the beef</h3>
            <p>Soak the leg bones in salt water with vinegar and wait for 2 hours. After that, wash the bones and simmer them along with ginger and 1 tbsp of salt in about 10 minutes, then blanch in cold water. This part makes sure the broth won't have any odor, while also enhancing the taste.</p>

            <p>For the other meaty ingredients, soak them, also into salt water with vinegar for around 15-20 minutes then boil them with the liquor, ginger and onions. Adding 1 tbsp of sugar, 1 tbsp of seasoning granules, ½ tbsp of salt to the water right before boiling is strongly recommended in order to enhance the flavor of beef. After 2 hours, blanch them in cold water, then thinly slice them.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Simmer the bones</h3>
            <p>Simmer the beef bones with 5 liters of water in around 12 hours. The longer you stew, the better the broth.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the broth and other ingredients</h3>
            <p>Peel and cut <em>half of</em> the onions, soak in cold water to keep them crisp, white and less pungent. Toast the other half with ginger and peanut worms until fragrant, then use kitchen string to tie up the spices in a piece of cheesecloth, and add it to the broth. Cover the pot and continue simmering for another 4 hours.</p>

            <p>Roast star anises, cinnamon, cardamoms, coriander seeds and cloves until fragrant. Don't roast for too long else the broth will be blackened. Afterwards, soak in boiling water for around an hour then put in cheesecloth and add to the broth.</p>

            <p>After simmering with the onions cheesecloth for 4 hours or the cinnamon cheesecloth for an hour, put them away from the pot, along with the bones. Add 60 grams of rock sugar, 4 tablespoons of salt, 5 tablespoons of seasoning powder, and 5 tablespoons of MSG. Taste the broth and adjust seasoning by adding more salt, sugar, and/or fish sauce as needed.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Assembling the pho</h3>
            <p>To serve, boil the noodles according to package instructions. Add to a bowl. Place a few slices of the beef chuck and the raw sirloin on the noodles. Bring the broth to a rolling boil and ladle it into each bowl. The hot broth will cook the beef.</p>
            
            <p>Garnish Pho with washed cilantro, sweet basil, and be sure to take your lime wedges and squeeze a lot of fresh lime juice over the top!</p>
